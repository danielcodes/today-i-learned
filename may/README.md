# May

### Week 1, 05/02/2016

Finally started the Async and performance book fron YDKJS

Learned that callbacks are thrown into an event loop that a queue, this means that there is an order in which things happen. (first in, first out)

Learned that asynchronous means `now and later`, parallel does not mean the same thing as parallel means occurring at the same time
