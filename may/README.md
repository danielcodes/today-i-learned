# May

### Week 1, 05/02/2016

Finally started the Async and performance book fron YDKJS

Learned that callbacks are thrown into an event loop that a queue, this means that there is an order in which things happen. (first in, first out)

Learned that asynchronous means `now and later`, parallel does not mean the same thing as parallel means occurring at the same time

### C++ GUI set up, again

Man oh man, I thought I was done programming with GUI's in C++. Technically I am, but grading GUI assignments does require me to set up the environment which is the most painful part

Spent the majority of Friday attempting to set up FLTK on Linux without much success, learning a lot of things in the process though
